t1_c95k75v,1,1,1,"I somewhat agree but I'm going to take a shot anyways. Perhaps I can get you to share in my ambivalence.  First some background stuff: There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding tort law (the law of civil liability) and I want to clear up some of the more common ones. (This would be a fruitless endeavor if we weren't starting on the same page.) Am I safe in assuming that:  1. You are not a lawyer, and 2. Your idea of what liability of law is comes from the waivers we have to sign when we go Scuba diving, parachuting, and mountain climbing?  Many of the provisions under those disclaimers are for CYA purposes only. Chances are, if someone tried to sue for most of the things covered under such a waiver they wouldn't win anyways, the cost of adding in such a provision is so cheap (the cost of a few extra peices of paper and ink) that companies feel its worthwhile to do so, in case they get an irrational jury or something.   The effect of this is that the boundaries of what might actually create liability are actually far, far narrower than what you might think just from reading the waivers.    That being said: I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making on two ground.  ********  First -- I would challenge the idea that possibility of civil remedy promotes poor decision-making with the fact that in all jurisdictions I know of, the defendant in a lawsuit for negligence has the defense of **comparative negligence**.   That is to say, if the defendant can show that the plaintiff was negligent and that contributed to his injury, the defendant may be relieved of some or all of his liability, depending on the degree of the plaintiff's negligence compared to that of the defendant.  Many states have the rule where if the plaintiff was even one iota negligent, the defendant is completely relieved of ANY liability regardless of how negligent he was. This is called **contributory negligence** and it's a little more controversial. (For the reasons you mention, I am ambivalent as to which is the better rule.)  Part two incoming (because apparently people are getting impatient)."
t1_c95tixb,1,1,1,"So basically, whether incentives from assigning liability actually in fact influence behavior -- because among other reasons people have imperfect perceptions of how responsibility is distributed?   Sorry man, I don't have a good answer. Your doubts are the doubts that I currently have, and the doubts that law professors and judges have been wrestling with for decades now. "

t1_cjy9w7i,5,5,5,"I understand your point, however I would argue not only did Summer allow the relationship to progress into a serious relationship from a FWB relationship, but she actively pursued it such as was the case when she told Tom all her secrets. She should have realised the difference she was making in that and subsequent scenes and stopped the relationship long before.  I absolutely agree that both are partly at blame, but I think Summer behaved worse by stating her intentions and then going back on them, before returning to them when it was too late."

If it was a close fight then things like title defenses, and success against the mutual opponents certainly come into play. But we watched him get utterly dominated in one round by someone you are raking well below him. It doesn't make much sense to me.

t1_csvrg7x,1,1,1,So how can Log Horizon be a ripoff of SAO if SAO itself was a ripoff?  Personally I think Log Horizon was a snoozefest but was still leagues better than SAO.

t1_csw1xe2,5,5,5,"That is true Kirito and Asuna took on Death Scythe together but really Kirito's dual wielding and newfound skill was what won the fight. Klein is not on Kirito's level in terms of strength, power or even battle-healing. IIRC Kirito has maxed out most if not all of his battle stats whilst Klein has decent to high-range stats. Not much of what he has mentioned has been explained in the actual series. I can't like Kirito because he never struggles to progress, he always screams his way out of everything and has never lost a fight. He breaks out of paralysis and saves Asuna, how did that happen? He destroys a boss monster because he's pissed off that his guild was wiped? I thought this was a group game? None of this can be explained because the writer made that fatal mistake. Top 50 anime don't make these core mistakes.   Sticking together is the best bet for every character in a group-based MMO but apparently Kirito is above that. Another question is how is Asuna's stats roughly lower or the same as Kirito's when she has been with an actual guild doing far more dungeons than what Kirito seemed to be doing?"
t1_ctlv7xc,1,1,2,"&amp;Delta; While I'm not *entirely* convinced, I will say I'm more open about the ruling in the case should be. I could see it going either way now. The franchise's response *would* try to address everything with an excuse, whether anyone were guilty or not, but most of it seems perfectly reasonable. The main thing I have a problem with was this:  &gt; One says to the other ""I have a big needle for you this week."" The response is ""Better be surrounded by cash and new kicks... or its a rugby sunday"". When asked about this message by investigators, Mcnally confirmed that the reference to ""rugby"" meant an over-inflated football.   &gt; Yeah, guys whose job it is to inflate the balls need needles to work the pumps. The request for cash clearly sounds like a joke, especially in the context of the rest of their text message jokes.  While it could be just a coincidence that looks really bad, I'm not buying that he was told he'd have to do his job and in response requested bribes of cash and shoes as a joke.  Thanks for the link to the team's response, I'll have to read that.  "
t1_cb3qcwp,5,5,5,"Because the claim that Martin acting in self defense (as an attempt to prevent a claim that Zimmerman acted in self-defense) makes no sense when you acknowledge that the ""terrified"" Martin chose not to escape the situation when given more than enough time.  If I thought I was being chased by someone who might hurt me, I'd be behind a locked door and calling the cops in under a minute.  Zimmerman did not, at the time, think that Martin was attacking him.  He thought he found the burglar, whose reactions, including the first flight, fit the expected profile of a criminal caught red handed.  Assuming Zimmeran's story was true (we just don't know), that makes Martin the one who initiated the physical conflict that led to Zimmerman fearing for his life and shooting Martin.  From common sense and forensics point of view, there are more unknowns that work in Zimmerman's favor than Martin's.  Martin is terrified and running away, but chooses not to move to safety.  Why?  Zimmerman somehow ended up on his back with a wounded head before shooting Martin (who was directly on top of him).  How?  Even their attitudes.  Zimmerman was don't-let-him-escape angry, while Martin seemed ""do anything to survive"" scared... It would be flip-a-coin over who started it, except that Martin seems to have chosen fight over flight in those 4 minutes when Zimmerman hadn't even gotten that far."

t1_cde6meq,1,1,2,"&gt; True I just don't think she had much wiggle room, most tails on animals are fairly accurate and within their control.  She has a bit of wiggle room in there, nothing crazy. But the queen is facing Ripley and trying to maneuver its tail from the back to the front from the side, which is not something many tailed creatures try to do.  &gt; I think the AvP series are no longer cannon since Prometheus came out  Howso? The Weyland in Prometheus is Peter Weyland, as as far as I can tell it takes place far after AvP. Charles Weyland could be his father or grandfather.  Edit: It could still no longer be cannon, but seeing as how AvP came out well after Alien3, it seemed like they were making a clear connection. Fun fact: Lance Henrikson is one of only two actors to be killed by a Predator, Xenomorph, and Terminator. The other is Bill Paxton.  &gt; But, this 'droid' was sent just to con Ripley - what's the point of screaming once she started to jump?  People do stuff all the time without a point, perhaps the robot was just going for *that* level of realism. It might not of even known it was synthetic."

t1_cky3f7y,1,1,1,I thought the commonly accepted explanation is that he *did* commit suicide?
t1_cky44de,5,5,4,"The title of your post made me think that you wanted convincing that mentally ill or depressed people killing themselves counts as suicide and shouldn't deserve pity. However, I'll add in a point of view that shows that others are responsible or at least complicit in aiding the death of Kurt Cobain.  Depression or drug use:  If an old person is at the top of a set of stairs walking down and her leg or hip breaks due to calcium deficiency. Because of this, she falls down the stairs and dies from the injuries. One would not say that the old person committed suicide. Blaming the death on the fall also not precise. It was the injury that should be blamed much as if another person pushed her down the stairs would be blamed.  Now, instead of an old person its a person with depression. They're at the top of the stairs looking down and their mind breaks too much at that moment and they toss themselves forward. The injuries from the fall leads to his death. Do you blame the person, the fall or the mental injury?  It's the above reasons that insurance companies pay out for suicide so long as the policy is two years or older. We assume that taking out a policy just prior to suicide makes the act a conscious thought with hopes that the death leads to a cash reward to others. However, suicide as a result of mental illness is not considered a rational choice and death from that is considered as much an accident as falling down the stairs due to a physical injury.   Considering the above, you could say that killing one's self due to depression is not suicide but death due to illness. As such, given the evidence with Kurt Cobain, he did not commit suicide.  Enabling:  If a person is depressed and taking illicit drugs and alcohol that exacerbates the problem, it can be deadly. Now, what about the people that know about that person's issues and callously ignores them and even offers to provide substances or enables the destructive behavior? I would argue that falls under reckless endangerment, and given the mental illness factor could be criminal in nature.   While Courtney loved Kurt (actually, I don't know, but let's just assume so), her lifestyle continued to pull Kurt further and further down till his mind snapped to the point that he killed himself. She was the one that provided the push, and if she was not mentally ill herself can be responsible for the death of Kurt.  Conspiracy:  Not touching that path. "
t1_ckyblqs,5,1,1,I believe it was a case of assisted suicide. No one knows how he got back home from the rehab centre with no money and bank accounts frozen.

t1_cmcf7ri,5,4,4,"I think whether Wilson *reasonably* believed himself to be in danger is a key issue.  I also think that the actions Wilson is alleged to have taken in the moments following their altercation in the car were reasonable.  The officer pursued the two boys as they ran from his car, which I think is a perfectly reasonable thing for a police officer to do, and shot Brown at some point after he'd turned around.  What Brown was actually doing after he turned around is under dispute, but the fact that there's a reasonable chance Brown was behaving in a way that would have appeared life-threatening to Wilson is, I think, sufficient legal justification for the action Wilson took.  My belief isn't even that Wilson was acting purely in self defense; my position is that it is *sufficiently likely* that Wilson was acting in self-defense, and that as a result he should not be put in jail."

t1_cmcz2h1,5,5,5,"I just read two full testimonies, one by Darren Wilson and one by Michael Brown's friend, who was with him at the time. It's hard to read either account without noting that Wilson did not make it clear to the men what was taking place before initiating the altercation. Wilson had yelled from his window for the two to stop walking in the street, and was upset when they didn't immediately change course. He reversed to them, tried to open his door, but it shut back on him because he didn't have room to open it. So, Wilson grabbed Brown by the neck from his window and started lecturing him, though no one is sure of their conversation, this is when the scuffle started.  This cop didn't use his speaker or lights or follow any normal police procedures to let these guys know what was going on. I don't dispute that Brown scared him at some point, but he approached this in a way that escalates situations, not defuses them as police are trained to do. Had Brown not died, it's more likely he would have received punishment for how poorly this situation was handled."

t1_cmcue6k,5,5,4,"Please.  Without so much professional training as it is on the job experience, take a look at the life of someone who takes care of 21+ year old autistic adults as caregivers.  I have seen the wounds. I've lived through lawsuits and lifechanging injuries. I've seen bite marks. Bite. Marks. Not only can you not up and shoot them, not only can you not use chemical sedation, you have to use simple physical restraint by one or more people to put them in a supine and hope help gets there before you get overpowered.   Get a chair thrown at you. Get bitten and be not allowed to scream or react at all. Have someone 50lbs your senior and 80 IQ points your inferior come at you like a raging bull.   If people can be trained and briefed on how to take down unarmed (or melee equipped) people with no concept of injury or harm in a blind rage without any collateral damage to the subject, he damn well could have handled it better.  I'm not saying the officer had to react THAT severely, but he had full ability to get to non-lethal before jumping up to shooting him 12 times. If THAT was his reaction to THAT scenario, he is unfit to be an officer of the law with a lethal weapon capacity. I expect that my tax dollars do not go to hiring glorified town guards.

So I'm gonna lay out the benefits and ignore the costs (related to care and such) that I'm sure you are aware of them with your cat experiences.  1) Your *Boo-Bear*  Yeah, I'm talking about your boyfriend, I'm not sure what you call each other, so I'm gonna roll with that.  Your Boo-Bear, for whatever reason, thinks that he wants a sphynx cat.  While your statement above is unclear, I am going to assume that he has experience with cats as well.  Now I would recommend that you ask him why he wants this particular type, and what he thinks of the cuddly issue.  But, remember that there is always the added benefit of, as long as you talk about it and do it together, making your Boo-Bear happy.  I'm not saying go along with it just because he wants to, but try to understand why he wants to, and realize that this is a decision you are making together, which really adds to the relationship.  2)  Holy shit that cat is sa-weeeeet!  First off, its distinct!  Your friends will be like ""woah! that's the coolest cat ever! So unique!""  It stands up proud like its not gonna take shit from nobody!  Also, its basically a God!  The Egyptians worshipped em, its even named for a mythical creature of incredible intelligence.  Hell, the Egyptians were so terrified of those things that during the Battle of Pelusium, the Persian Cambyses II released hundreds of 'em and the Egyptian refused to fight, lest they harm their Cat-God.  Persians killed em where they stood! That cat helped conquer nations, can a tabby say that?  2) Now its disputed but they may be better for people with allergies.  See they don't have fur, and people are allergic to chemicals in cat dander, which is spread all over by the fur, when they're petter or whatever.  But this ain't got none of those little allergy missiles!  So while the allergy problem isn't TOTALLY gone, it is reduced.  Now you can make friends with the lesser-folk!  3)  ANYTHING can be cuddly!  My friend has porcupine he carries everywhere!  His roommate sleeps with his snake wrapped all around him!  He even just got a badass tarantula that sits on his shoulder!  See, you just need to appreciate your pet, and to accept it for what it has to offer!

I really liked it, but one of the reasons I did was because my ancestors homesteaded in Texas, and were involved in the ""all bidness"" in the 20th Century."
t1_ccikowu,5,5,5,"There Will Be Blood is a character study. And like in all character studies the plot is only really relevant in so far as it develops the character. So saying there isn't much of a plot isn't really a critique. There doesn't necessarily need to be one.   As far as Plainview's character. I don't see any sort of sudden shift after H.W. loss of hearing. From the very start Plainview is a ruthless business man to the point of being a sociopath. When Plainview takes H.W. initially it isn't because he cares for the child, but because he sees a way to take advantage of him to further his business. Plainview consistently shows throughout the movies that he will go to any length to make more money. And that is the purpose that Henry serves. You notice that Plainview lets Henry hang around up until the point where he threatens the business, then Plainview snaps and murders this man that we thought he had formed a loose bond with.   As for Eli, he is not supposed to be a likeable character. I am surprised that you don't think his speeches were any good as they are some of the most striking and forceful in recent memory. And despite the high pitched voice he is a very strong character and nearly as ruthless as Plainview. Being soft spoken doesn't prevent people from rising to power especially in a religion like Christianity that praises meekness. You will also notice that his parish seems to be well cowed with no particularly strong individuals.   I am also quite shocked you didn't like the music. I don't think there is any way to change your view on this as it is going to come down to a matter of taste. However, myself and most other people that saw it found it was widely considered one of the best soundtracks of the year. It would have been a strong contender for the Oscar for best score, but it used non-original material."

t1_c9ye0ac,1,1,1,"Still, he's hungry"
t1_ckuh8hs,5,5,4,"&gt; Pretty simple. Basically this video makes a perfect point. Batman might think he is not killing people, but he is straight up killing lots of people. If you knock someone out and they don't wake up in a few minutes, then you have done serious damage and they very well could die. If you are running around with sharp metal weapons and ninja stars, you are going to kill people. If you are smashing through walls with rockets and driving through shopping centres on a motorbike you are going to cause some casualties eventually. In the Arkam games Batman is frequently seen bashing the heads in of people with a metal pipe. How is that not killing them?  People in the DC universe are absurdly resilent. Criminals are regularly thrown through windows and walls without any lasting harm. Ordinary civilians and bystanders can jump higher, run faster, and take more punishment than a normal human would be able to. For instance, Batman, an ordinary human at peak physical health, runs faster than Usain Bolt, regularly lifts more than the human world record, and recovers from injuries faster than should be humanly possible. The DC human brain is probably more shock-resistant than a normal human brain.  &gt; In DKR Batman organizes a mass assault on Bane, knowing the police are using guns, and Bane's troops are using guns, which leads to a lot of deaths. If Batman were to say that he didn't kill these people, it would be like a General ordering troops to fire on an enemy, and when that enemy is killed, saying he had nothing to do with it. In Batman begins, Batman had every intention of having Gordon blow up the train tower which would cause the train to crash, and every intention of leaving Ra's al Ghul there to die. He said he wasn't killing him, he just wasn't saving him. That's just the same as Batman pulling the trigger on a gun and saying ""I am not killing you, the bullet is"". He made the plan, and executed it, knowing Ra's al Ghul would die.  You forget the point of Batman's no-kill rule. It isn't an arbitrary requirement he throws on himself for no reason. The no-kill rule is simply to hold himself back in the absence of public accountability, legal restrictions, or responsible partners (Robin is a kid. He doesn't count). When the cops fought Bane or when Gordon blew up the train tower, there were other people in the plot to ensure that Batman wasn't murdering out of petty revenge. The Batman can only kill out of absolute self-defense or under the eye of others to prevent himself from being the next Two-Face, Rorschach, or Ozymandias.  "
t1_ckuwqi8,5,5,5,"Batman from the Dark Knight Trilogy is pretty terrible. He definitely kills Harvey, and, from any reasonable perspective, kills Ra's as well. To an extent, he also causes Talia to die in a car accident. He also has no qualms about Catwoman killing Bane.  In summary, Nolan-Bats is a pretty bad example of Batman. The rest of your argument can proceed with the more canonical Batmen. "
t1_c9v8fs2,4,1,4,"I don't believe I ever said that threats of suicide shouldn't be taken seriously. I agree with the opposite.

In the back of my mind I always wondered why he chose such an unreliable method. Of course I never said that to him out of common  decency but I was illegitimately curious for the reasons behind it.

Well a little, but more as a suggestion for when she gets out. He hasn't attempted to be with her sexually, which is a lot more than a good chunk of the other guards can say.   Healy may be bigoted and racist, but not outwardly to the inmates themselves.

Having said that, I feel like they do a decent job with that character.  He is supposed to be helping inmates, but he has been there a long time, and people who are in positions like that have something similar to battle fatigue where they become less compassionate and more suspicious of games.    I think that he realizes that he made some terrible moves in Season 1 &amp; the beginning of Season 2, and is trying/ did try to help.  He had that Circle group with Penn, and he tries to help Red when he can.    Like many people, he is actually a combination of decency and selfishness or pettiness.    He may not be the best at his job, but he isn't the worst.  And in that system, sometimes the one who isn't selling drugs &amp; having sex with inmates, etc, is the one who is ""good"" at his job, by comparison.    Although, my vote for the one prison guard who seems to actually be good at his job would have to be Ford.

t1_ch33yi9,1,1,1,"I'll have to disagree with you on doing the exact same thing.  The end result may be similar, but that does not account for what happens before and after the fact.

I would similarly not be able to blame say a male getting more than he wanted in an S&amp;M situation simply because I don't know enough to properly assess that situation.

Even once he and Nancy break up and you'd think now is the time for him to do tell Joseph without caring about upsetting Nancy, he doesn't. Why? Again - either A or B above. "

t1_cqcq11x,1,1,1,"Or because plenty of Native Americans celebrate it and Dale knows that, as well as history not being quite what people think it is."
t1_cpov03f,5,5,5,"First of all, Dale is a much better role model than John Redcorn. Redcorn is a womanizing, selfish, greedy (as evidenced by how he's willing to drop Luanne's Manger Babies from his VHS distribution company), and all around pompous person (he thinks his shitty death metal band is the greatest thing ever). He's also an extremely anger filled man, constantly discussing taking revenge on ""the white man"".   Dale, albeit a little crazy and paranoid, is actually kind, caring, thoughtful and above all else, selfless (remember when he saved the Stick-Tec office by killing thousands of roaches with his bare hands? Or when he rushed to save Joseph from the alien overlords at the Marfa Lights? Or the countless times he's shown his devotion and love for his wife?). The only thing Dale really dislikes is Bill, for being so pathetic and disgusting, and Rusty Shackleford, for totally made up reasons.   So it's much better for Joseph to grow up a little weird if it means he gets to learn good, quality values. The only thing he'd learn from John Redcorn is how to be a selfish asshole who fucks any woman he can in a vendetta against an entire race of people.   We also see that Joseph thinks John Redcorn is a pretty weird dude in the Thanksgiving episode, so I'm pretty sure going to live with him would be pretty damaging to Joseph. Not to mention that John Redcorn doesn't know the first thing about parenting.     Also, sure John Redcorn might be hurt that he doesn't get to raise Joseph, *but that's the price you pay when you stick your dick in another man's wife*. Seriously, fuck John Redcorn. I'm glad he has to silently suffer while watching Dale raise his kid. He's a piece of shit, so the resulting harm to him is negligible.  And as other people said, Hank typically stays out of people's personal business. Even if it's totally fucked up, he tries to keep personal details like sexual relations completely secret (he doesn't even like Luanne using the bathroom in his and Peggy's room). He would *never* broach the subject of intimate sexual relations with his friends - he avoids those conversations at all costs (watch the episode where Connie gets her first period for ample evidence of this aversion).   He also sees how destructive divorce can be, thanks to Bill. Hank sort of sees the value in ""ignorance is bliss"" at least when it comes to Dale. Bill at least has a steady paying military job. Dale would be homeless trying to live off of Dale's Deadbug (we're constantly reminded that Nancy is the breadwinner, and we see in the episode where Nancy goes to work in Dallas that Dale cannot take care of himself). So it's actually better for Dale to not be privy to the true father of Joseph as well.   If Hank told Dale, and Dale believed him (which is also a stretch), then it would ruin pretty much everyone's lives who are involved in it. Dale becomes homeless, Joseph is now a child of divorced parents who realizes at 13 that he's a different race than he thought, Nancy would have to deal with the publicity that would likely result from this, and John Redcorn's life as he knows it comes crashing down once he has legal guardianship over a child (no more banging sluts when he's gotta take Joseph to football practice)."
t1_cpp08sy,1,1,1,"Hank once said about Dale's mental state: &gt;We're putting extra stress on a structure that wasn't up to code in the first place.  I get your point, but I think it was entirely reasonable of Hank to conclude that Dale couldn't handle this and that everybody would be happier/better off with the lie."

He runs towards you with the bat. You shoot him.   Under your legal analysis, did you escalate the situation and therefore the robber is acting in self defense?

t1_cautyr8,1,1,4,"Maybe we are losing sight of something here. According to Zimmerman, Martin verbally threatened to kill him.

They were very good after surgery, but one eye has slightly diminished. The eye doctor told me that this will be a good thing in the next fifteen or twenty years and will prevent me from needing reading glasses. In the meantime I do not need contacts or glasses.   I cycle and rock climb (and run, swim, weight lift, etc., etc.). Most things I enjoyed were impossible in glasses and as I got older it was harder to wear contacts.

I was standing to the outside of the crowd purposefully to avoid being in the pit, and was pushed into a pit by the people around me. I ended up fucking up my back and having issues walking for about a week afterwards. I did not volunteer to be in that pit, I did not stand too close to it for it to be my fault. Not everybody who finds themselves in a pit wants to be there. As well, when some asshole cold clocks you in the face (which happened to me in another pit) it stands to reason that you're going to be pissed. And I would imagine the majority of people you see whining or complaining fall into one of those two categories - over aggressive assholes pushing you into a pit, or over aggressive assholes hurting you on purpose in said pit.

t1_cau9bgr,2,1,2,"Well, if you watch the video, the dog already started attacking at 3:22, jumping at the officer. It even looks like its paws may have made contact with the guy, but it's hard to tell from this angle and quality. But it was definitely starting to attack.  Unless you have good reason to believe it wasn't attacking. Hit me. After all this is CMV.   Also, regarding tasers, if it was a human adult taser, that may have likely killed the dog as well. I'm admittedly limited in knowledge on tasers and their use in law enforcement, but if TASER Int'l themselves can no longer legally advertise their products as ""non-lethal,"" then I'd hesitate to say they should have gone that route. I'm pretty sure that animal control is equipped with tasers of smaller voltages for smaller animals. But again, I suck at tasers, so if anyone wants to correct me then I'm up for it.  Also yeah the arrest was unwarranted and legislation to prevent recording of the police is stupid. That's not the issue at hand though. It *should* be the issue at hand, but everyone's all up in arms over the fact that the dog died, not over bad legislation or bad police work. Everyone's mad at the wrong shit. They're calling the police department, not the state Congress."
t1_cauamra,1,1,1,I'm currently being downvoted in another thread for suggesting Zimmerman escalated the situation.  Good answer.
t1_cauatj3,1,1,2,"When the dog that got shot jumped, it snapped at the air where the cop's arm had just been. Watch the video frame by frame or slowed down. You can see its bared teeth.  I've grown up with large dogs. German Shepherds, to be precise. This dog's demeanor was not friendly. It was not obviously aggressive, as some dogs are, but it could easily have been the unsettling quiet aggression that goes from 0 to 60 in a heartbeat. I'd have to be in the officer's shoes to know for sure."
t1_cau9nhu,4,1,1,"Their reaction was extremely heavy handed. They could have let the guy calm his dog down, despite the fact he was in cuffs. The dog was showing only very mild annoyance, and this was because the cops were threatening his owner.   If we look at the situation from the time the dog jumps out the window of the car, I still think the cops have done poorly here.  If the dog did not approach the cops, what were they going to do? Just let it wander the neighbourhood?   Once the dog was loose, they should have helped the guy sort his dog out, and then taken him away. The guy was giving no resistance.  But no, the dog was shot instead. In a residential neighbourhood. Where the situation was already very calm. "
t1_cauc7tb,1,1,1,"This exactly. I usually try not to overreact, but if given the chance, and with no consequences for me, I would end that officer's life.; He doesn't deserve to live and is just a liability."

t1_ck496qz,3,1,4,"&gt;Arvo came to get Clem's group, they didn't stumble onto him.    Maybe they were scavenging in the area? I mean, he had that medicine stuffed in a trash can.    &gt;How did Kenny go ""too far""?    Uh, did you stay and watch what he did? He didn't just kill him enough to stop him becoming a walker, he viciously beat him several times until his head turned into pulp."
t1_chkfbo3,5,5,5,"I don't agree there was zero conflict. She felt the White Lotus was confining her. All of the previous Avatars got to travel the world while she gets stuck in a compound where her life is scripted. She didn't have any friends her age until she got to Republic City whereas Aang references Kuzon, Bumi, and the other Air Nomad children. Aang wasn't confined or ostracized from his friends until he was told he was the Avatar. He doesn't know his parents as that is Air Nomad custom, but otherwise it seemed he had more of a childhood than Korra did, who was confined to her compound for training.   The scenarios are different. Aang was told he was the Avatar pretty late and he had not yet been trained. In fact, being taken away from Gyatso for Avatar training was literally the reason for running away. He didn't give it a chance.   I made another comment below - Aang refused the resources given to him until he was put in dire circumstances. It's different than not having had those resources at all. "
t1_cl89vmf,1,1,1,I think that's what the author is getting at. Nobody will help this kid with what is troubling him not even something so basic.
